ruby-hunspell is a Ruby language extension that wraps around the spell-checking
functions provided by the Hunspell library.

Hunspell library derived from OpenOffice.org's MySpell, and is being used for
recent versions of OpenOffice.org itself.

This extension has been started with the intent to provide an alternative to
rbot's original spell-checking plugin, so that it would use hunspell directly
rather than using the command-line interface of ispell (that is definitely less
elaborated).

The build system is CMake, rather than Ruby's xmkmf-based extbuild.rb script, as
the latter does not support C++ libraries as dependencies. The support scripts
should work just as fine on UNIX-like systems (Linux, FreeBSD, ...) and Windows,
so that the extension can be built and used whenever Ruby and Hunspell are
present.

Unfortunately up to 1.1.4, Hunspell does not provide shared libraries that can
be used by other software, so only static linking is available, and this does
not work, to create a shared extension, on architectures like x86_64.
For this reason, if you want to build ruby-hunspell on those architecture, you
need the libtool patch applied in Gentoo Portage, that builds shared libraries
built with PIC support.
